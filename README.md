# hello-world
My first github that i'm gittin goin on.  I'm exploring this space and learning what git and github is all about.
It sounds very interesting!  I am not a developer, but did take a Fortran class back in the day.
Since then, I have watched programming from a distance & always wanted to get back into it.
